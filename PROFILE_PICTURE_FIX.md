# Profile Picture Fix - App-Specific Storage

## Problem Fixed
The app was showing storage permission popups and failing to update profile pictures even after granting permissions. This was because the original implementation tried to access public external storage, which requires complex permissions on modern Android.

## Solution Implemented
Changed to **app-specific storage** approach that doesn't require special permissions:

### 1. Removed Problematic Permissions
- Removed `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- Removed `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`  
- Removed `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
- Removed `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO`
- Removed `ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION`

### 2. Kept Essential Permissions
- `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` - for Android 13+ gallery access
- `CAMERA` - for camera functionality

### 3. Updated Storage Approach
- **Before**: Tried to create folder in public storage (like `/storage/emulated/0/Quiz Master/`)
- **After**: Uses app-specific directories (like `/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.quiz_master.app/files/Quiz Master/`)

### 4. Benefits
- ✅ No permission popups on app startup
- ✅ Profile picture updates work reliably
- ✅ App folder structure still created
- ✅ Images saved locally and securely
- ✅ Works on all Android versions

## Technical Details

### File Locations
Profile pictures are now saved to:
```
/Android/data/com.quiz_master.app/files/Quiz Master/Profile Pictures/
```

### Folder Structure Created
```
Quiz Master/
├── Profile Pictures/    (User profile photos)
├── Quiz Data/          (Quiz statistics)
├── Backups/           (User data backups)
├── Media/             (App media files)
└── README.txt         (Information file)
```

### Code Changes
1. **UserProvider** - Simplified permission handling and storage paths
2. **AndroidManifest.xml** - Removed unnecessary permissions
3. **Image picker** - Uses modern approach without external storage access

## How It Works Now
1. User opens app → No permission popup
2. User clicks "Change Profile Picture"
3. User selects Gallery or Camera
4. Image picker opens (built-in Android functionality)
5. User selects/takes photo
6. Image is automatically saved to app folder
7. Profile picture updates successfully

## Testing
The updated implementation has been tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ App builds without errors
- ✅ No permission popups during normal usage
- ✅ Image picker works for both gallery and camera
- ✅ Profile pictures save and display correctly
- ✅ App folder structure is created automatically

## User Experience
- **Before**: Permission popup → Grant permission → Still fails to update
- **After**: Direct access to gallery/camera → Image updates successfully

The fix eliminates permission-related issues while maintaining all functionality.
